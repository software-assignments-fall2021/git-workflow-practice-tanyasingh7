Smashing Magazine is an online front-end development and design magazine.
I like the website because I really enjoy front-end development and design and the
website has a variety of different types of resources relating to the two.
Not only does the magazine have articles, but it also has workshops, guides, books, a job board,
a podcast, newsletter, and much more. Personally, I'm a big fan of their articles.
There is a wide range of categories of topics to look through as well. The topics
include Accessibility, Android, Animation, Apps, CSS, Design, Design Patterns, Design
Systems, E-Commerce, Freebies, Graphics, HTML, Illustrator, Inspiration, iOS, JavaScript,
Mobile, Pattern Libraries, Performance, Photoshop, Plugins, React, Responsive Design,
Service Workers, Sketch, Typography, UI, Usability, User Experience, Wallpapers, WebDesign,
WordPress, Workflow. If you're interested in any of these topics, I recommend checking
out the website! Also the website is really easy to navigate and it's designed well (as expected)
